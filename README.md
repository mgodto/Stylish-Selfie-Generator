# Stylish-Selfie-Generator

This is the final project of the course 2020EE3662-DSPLab in National Tsing Hua University.

## Introduction

In modern days, people are extremely concerned with their outfit due to the widespread of social application. As a result, having a stylish mugshot is indeed a big thing in concern. Due to this fact, we try to implement a user interface that enables the users to generate stylish mugshots with several styles by different algorithms and method.

## Proposed methods
Our projects contain 3 methods for generating the style, which are NPR drawing generation, Pencil sketch generation and Style Transfer.
The first two are work with the mathmetical base algorithms, and the last is based on deep learning method from the "paper Xun Huang and Serge Belongie (2017, March), Arbitrary Style Transfer in Real-time with Adaptive Instance Normalization [v2], arXiv, Retrieved January, 1, 2021, from https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06868".

## Usage
Our user interface is implemented with python package TKinter. First you can select a selfie as input to generate stylish image, and then Select a mode to do transformation. Specifically, if we want to do style transfer, we can choose to use some selected fine styles or enable the random choice option (from 20K+ artworks) to have a surprise on unexpected result. Finally, you can download the result to your device and enjoy your stylish selfie.
