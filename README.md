# Stylish-Selfie-Generator

This is the final project of the course 2020EE3662-DSPLab in National Tsing Hua University.

## Introduction

In modern days, people are extremely concerned with their outfit due to the widespread of social application. As a result, having a stylish mugshot is indeed a big thing in concern. Due to this fact, we try to implement a user interface that enables the users to generate stylish mugshots with several styles by different algorithms and method.

## Usage
Our user interface is implemented with python package TKinter. First you can select a selfie as input to generate stylish image, and then Select a mode to do transformation. Specifically, if we want to do style transfer, we can choose to use some selected fine styles or enable the random choice option (from 20K+ artworks) to have a surprise on unexpected result. Finally, you can download the result to your device and enjoy your stylish selfie.
